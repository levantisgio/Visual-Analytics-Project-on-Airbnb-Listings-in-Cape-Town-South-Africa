# Visual-Analytics-Project-on-Airbnb-Listings-in-Cape-Town-South-Africa

This GitHub repository showcases my visual analytics project on Airbnb listings in Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa, conducted during
my master's degree studies at the University of Piraeus. The project involved analyzing three datasets containing comprehensive information
about Airbnb apartments in the area. (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).

In this repository, you will find the cleaned and preprocessed datasets, along with the Python code used for data 
exploration, feature engineering, and visualization. The code leverages popular libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, 
Geopandas and Folium to generate insightful visualizations, including box plots, bar plots, heatmaps, and choropleth maps.

The project highlights trends and correlations between property types, prices, bedrooms, and neighborhoods, providing valuable information 
for individuals interested in Airbnb apartment rentals in Cape Town. The repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of the project, 
allowing others to understand the analytical process, replicate the findings, and further explore the dataset for their own research 
purposes.
